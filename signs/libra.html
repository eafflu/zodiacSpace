             Peace, love, and harmony is the Libra M.O. You’ll instantly be swept away by Libra’s charm and pleasant demeanor, enchanged
            by their wide array of conversation topics. Libra people are the perfect partners for a social justice project, interior
            design masterpiece, or even just a peaceful day picnicking in the park and strolling around the town. Set these social butterflies
            free at a networking event and they’ll own the room. Some Libras can be reserved and formal at first. But once you get them
            talking, a five minute conversation can morph into a three-hour philosophical discourse! Because Libra seeks compromise,
            this sign dislikes conflict and anything that feels “unfair.” In fact, if you meet an angry Libra, chances are this sign
            is riled up about an ongoing injustice. Their system simply can’t tolerate it! Many Libras are natural diplomats who will
            do everything to negotiate between warring parties that just can’t get along. They can accurately see both sides to a situation,
            and often resolve disputes in an equitable way for all involved. However, there is a population of Libras whose Venusian
            appetites rule them, eclipsing their sign’s sensibility and driving them to pursue material indulgence at any cost. These
            Librans use their natural charms and good looks to manipulate others into taking care of them or doing their bidding. As
            the sign of the Judge, some Libras can even tip the scales into dictatorial behavior and power trips (Libras Simon Cowell,
            Margaret Thatcher and Vladimir Putin are examples of Libras with a “my way or the highway” attitude). When it comes to their
            own decision-making, they have an even harder time and will vacillate between “Should I?” or “Shouldn’t I?” You can find
            Libra people taking in culture at a gallery opening, indulging in a sweet treat or gourmet health food, or shopping for a
            couture or hand-crafted piece to add to their impressive wardrobes.
