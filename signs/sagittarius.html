             Send in the clowns! Witty Sagittarians can be some of the funniest and most entertaining people you’ll meet. They have a
            gift for seeing the absurdity of human nature and turning it into comic material. Yet, Sagittarians can also be wise and
            philosophical, revealing perspectives you might not otherwise see. This sign is ruled by the Centaur, a half-human, half-horse
            mythical creature. From the waist up, these knowledge-seekers are reaching for the highest truth. From the waist down…it’s
            all animal instinct and restless hooves. (It’s not easy being the ruler of ethics and the hips and thighs!) Busy Sagittarians
            have a million friends, projects and irons in the fire. As a result, they may not be the most reliable day-to-day allies.
            But if you have a five-alarm crisis, they’ll rush in for an epic save, even if you haven’t seen them in years. Time and distance
            are irrelevant to this sign—they have friends in every port, and if they connect with you, that’s all that matters. Personal
            development falls under the Sagittarius domain. They’re always up for meeting in a far-flung locale, taking a road trip or
            joining you for a weekend workshop. Falling for a Sag? Proceed at your own risk. While they can be deeply loyal and monogamous,
            these explorers must first sow their oats. Sagittarius is known as the “bachelor” sign. These natural risk-takers love to
            take on dares, and are shameless flirts to boot. You might find them organizing a talent show, rocking the karaoke mic, standing
            in an airport line, publishing a tell-all blog, or cracking bawdy jokes in the midst of a meeting.
